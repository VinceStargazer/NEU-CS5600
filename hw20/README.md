# How to manipulate remote files on the server via client commands
1. Write a local file from the client to the server: `./rfs WRITE <local-file-path> <remote-file-path>`. If the remote file path is omitted, use the same path as the local file by default. If such a file name already exists on the server side, the server will automatically create a new version with the highest version number (e.g., writing to result.txt creates result_1.txt).
2. Retrieve a remote file from the server and write it to the client: `./rfs GET <remote-file-path> <local-file-path>`. If the local file path or name is omitted, use the current folder. You can also add "-v[number]" after "GET" (e.g., `./rfs GET -v2 <remote_file_path> <local-file-path>`) to request a specific version of a file.
3. Delete a file or folder in the remote file system: `./rfs RM <remote-file-path>`. If successful, all versions of the given file will be removed.
4. Get all versioning information (i.e., the name of the file and all timestamps when the versions were last written to) about a remote file on the server side: `./rfs LS <remote-file-path>`. You can also append ` > <local-file-path>` to the command to pipe the output to a local file.
